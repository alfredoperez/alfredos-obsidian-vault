## How to track your deep work?

- Stopwatch Method:

  - Note the start time whenever you set the intention to do deep work
  - Whenever you break your deep work, note the end time
  - At the end of the day, count up the total time
  - Discard chunks less than 30 minutes
  - When to stop your count:

    - Stop whenever you initiate an interruption ( email, message, etc)
    - Whenever you're interrupted for more than 5 minutes
    - Bathroom breaks, getting a drink of water today, but not if you are checking your phone
    - Starting a new task is also okay, provided is also deep work
