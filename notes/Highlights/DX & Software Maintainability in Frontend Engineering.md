## Highlights
- Our main goal was to understand the biggest problems and technical challenges we have in our current frontend application and build a thorough vision of how we can move forward.
- Improve and enable better user and developer experience
- Improving DX makes our engineers move faster, increase their productivity to work on business projects, and ship products without (much) friction. Improving DX also can enable better UX as engineers are moving fast to ship product features, find bugs and easily fix them and focus more on the business part of coding.
- Focusing on the developer experience that enables better user experience was my goal and a great variable when thinking in prioritization of what I should work on.
- I noticed the similarities and started to document the same technical debts, reimagining future architectures, building abstractions that could be reused across the organization, proposing new ways to handle data contracts and consistent state management, build tools to improve DX, etc
- writing tests as examples, document all my learning, and improving our test setup.
- I started writing simple recipes to use the testing-library and about testing-driven development in React. Then I wrote tests for different use cases: query elements, expecting content, user behavior (click, focus, etc), custom hooks, better setup for components using redux
- The idea behind this was to make the tests very easy to implement and improve all the pain points
