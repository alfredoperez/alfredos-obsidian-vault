## Highlights
- Step 1: Planning
- Long before you sit down to put digital pen to paper, you need to make sure you have everything you need to sit down and write.
- Choose a Topic That Interests YOU
- Nothing – and I mean NOTHING – will kill a blog post more effectively than a lack of enthusiasm from the writer.
- Write an Outline For Your Post
- An outline doesn’t need to be lengthy, or even detailed – it’s just a rough guide to make sure you don’t ramble on and on about something tangential to your topic
- Do Your Research
- Nobody is right all the time, though, so approach every source with a the practiced skepticism of a journalist and question everything until you’re positive your information is solid.
- Check Your Facts
- If you try to slip something past your readers, you can bet that they’ll call you out on it, further compounding the damage. Be honest, be accountable, and fix it – fast.
- Step 2: Writing a Great Headline
- There are two main approaches you can take to writing blog post headlines. You can either decide on your final headline before you write the rest of your post (and use your headline to structure your outline), or you can write your blog post with a working title and see what fits when you’re done.
- Another common technique is posing a question in your headline.
- Step 3: The Writing Part
- Similarly to headlines, there are two main approaches to writing a blog post. You can either sit down and write an entire draft in a single sitting (my preferred workflow), or you can chip away at it gradually over time.
- However, I’d recommend getting as much done in one session as possible. This makes it easier to stay focused on the topic, minimizes the chance that you’ll forget crucial points, and also lets you get the damned thing out of your hair faster.
- NOTE: A lot of people struggle with writing introductions. A great strategy is to write the introduction last. Just get into the meat of the blog post, and worry about the introduction later.
- Using Images Effectively
- Images Help Your Blog Post Flow More Effectively
- Images Make Great Visual Punchlines
- Images Make Complex Topics More Easily Understandable
- The Editing Part
- Although sentence structure and grammar are both very important, editing is about seeing the piece as a whole and, sometimes, being willing to sacrifice words (and the hours it took to write them) for the sake of cohesion.
- Avoid Repetition
- Read Your Post Aloud to Check Flow
- Have Someone Else Read Your Work
- Keep Sentences Short and Paragraphs Shorter
- Accept That Your Blog Post Will Never Be Perfect
- Don’t Be Afraid to Make Cuts or Adapt on the Fly
