## Highlights
- Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=169))
- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=195))
- A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=200))
- learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=214))
- In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=229))
- There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganise everything you already have. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=243))
- it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=246))
- “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=278))
- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=457))
