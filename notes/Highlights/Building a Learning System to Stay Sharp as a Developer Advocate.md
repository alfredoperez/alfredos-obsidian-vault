## Highlights
- One way is to work as a team to build internal tools that get used on a regular basis. When done right, this strategy can sharpen skills like project management, Agile, and deployment (not to mention the skill of working on a development team!)
- There's a third way that I'm working through right now: developing a personal learning strategy and system. It's sort of the inverse of a "content marketing strategy," but could also be used as the start of the pipeline for that process. The temptation for first creating both a personal learning system and a content marketing strategy is to ask, "What's new and shiny and will get me clicks and engagement?"
- prefer to ask instead: "What are the real problems facing developers right now and what are the technologies they are using to solve them?" This leads us right back to our original problem: how do we know what technology is solving problems in the real world when we're not writing production code anymore? Here is where we have to keep our ear to the ground. We have to listen. We have to hang out, help out where we can, and learn what others are learning.
- Here are my "user requirements" for a learning system:
  It has to yield measurable results. I have to be able to know whether I'm doing a good job and how I can improve.
  It has to result in deliverables that can be shipped. This could be open source contribution, videos, articles, or something else, but it has to be something outside of my own head that can benefit other people.
  It has to be fun and natural in order to be sustainable and efficient.
- Obstacle 1: Getting Better at Learning in Public
- I write a ton in order to synthesize information while making videos, talks, and articles; I just never share my notes or my production process because they never feel good enough to publish. I'd like to start getting better about that for two reasons: 1) it will help me document my own progress publicly and 2) it may help others trying to systematize and share their own learning process, whether to get a job or just move to the next level.
- Obstacle 2: Reducing Cognitive Setup
- For any given area I am currently working on, I can track:
  Why I want to learn it
  "Anchor resources" — core courses or tutorials I'm working through
  "Reference resources" — any other collateral learning material I've come across
  Notes on what I'm learning (especially whatever context I need to jump back in quickly)
  My progress in each of the anchor resources
  Ideas on content to create in this area
  Next actions I need to take
