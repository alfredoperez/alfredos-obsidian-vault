- “Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you’ve failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.” ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G3GFLTX&location=782))

- The Leangains Method is formulated for lifters who want to shed fat as fast as possible while maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength, with a minimum of effort and needless complexity. That is, effort and complexity that cannot be scientifically, logically, or behaviorally justified shall hold no place in the diet, or dominion over the individual.

- Strategy: Get as close to 60 percent protein as possible. In practical terms, this means you’ll be eating 300 grams of protein on a 2,000-calorie diet. ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G3GFLTX&location=1239))

- Strategy: Eat two to three meals a day, whenever you want. Although you can vary this frequency from day to day, eating one meal on Monday and three meals on Tuesday, I strongly suggest you stick to one meal pattern, and maintain it for the duration of your diet.

- Strategy: Eat lots of vegetables, preferably dark leafy greens.  This will keep you full and happy, and everything moving smoothly, due to high fiber intake. You’ll also be getting less energy (calories) than you think, so don’t be shy, and pile on the veggies. For men, I recommend ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G3GFLTX&location=1295))

- Eating carbs directly before or after training yields a higher thermic effect (ref. 11,13). Additionally, eating carbs at these times may also lead to better workouts and enhanced post-workout recovery. With the Leangains Method, carb intake is limited, and usually not much higher than 100 grams per day—so make the most of it, and center them around training.   Strategy: Include a fruit in your pre-workout ([Location 1328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G3GFLTX&location=1328))

- For exercise tutorials, I recommend the YouTube channel of a gentleman named Alan Thrall. Search for “Alan Thrall squat” or “Alan Thrall deadlift” (or any exercise of your choice) and you’ll receive excellent instruction and advice on the technical aspects of the lifts, far superior to the abhorrent advice you’re likely to suffer from your run-of-the-mill personal trainer.
