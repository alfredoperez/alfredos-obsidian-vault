## Highlights

- In a traditional company, a product manager sits in the middle between business stakeholders and the engineering team.
  The business stakeholders are making decisions about what to build. The product manager is working with them to turn those decisions into viable software.

- A mercenary team is one that is really an order-taker. They’re being told to build something specific and they’re just building exactly what they were asked to build, whereas a missionary team has been tasked with a mission. There’s an objective they’re trying to reach, and they join the team, buy into the mission, and deliver higher quality software.
