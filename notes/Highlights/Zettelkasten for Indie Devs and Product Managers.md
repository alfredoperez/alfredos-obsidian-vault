## Highlights
- It’s critical to write all notes in your words and as short as possible, don’t copy and paste the content
- How is this useful? After some time, you build a dense network of ideas. Clusters emerge. In my case, around feature ideas. If a particular feature has many connected notes, my understanding on that feature is probably very mature. I can browse through the notes (since they have clickable links) and create a draft for a specification document.
- take the inbox note, quickly evaluate if it adds anything valuable to my system and either delete it or elaborate, then file it. If I decide there is something useful in it, I create a permanent slip-box note which contains a single, atomic idea. Again it’s written in my words. I look into my network of existing notes (sometimes using the search function) to find other notes which have the same context and link them together to a chain of thoughts with branches (not unlike GitHub).
