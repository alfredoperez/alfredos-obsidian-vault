## Highlights
- When things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations, we tend to regard the situation itself as the problem, but in reality whatever problems we experience come from our mind. ([Location 73](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H2QZ44W&location=73))
- Problems arise only if we respond to difficult external situations with a negative state of mind. Therefore, if we really want to be free from problems we must learn to control our mind by controlling our desire.
