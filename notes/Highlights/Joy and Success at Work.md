## Highlights
- When you free all your people to do what they love (or think they might love) instead of requiring them to learn and do things they don’t love, you not only strengthen their self-awareness but take a big step toward making your company more effective, efficient, and profitable.

- Taking care of our own well-being is not selfish; it is how we free ourselves to fully engage in the other segments of life. It keeps us finely attuned to and able to quickly spot wrinkles in life-work balance. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0845Q9PJM&location=411))

- As leaders, one of the most important things we can do to assure our companies’ success is to place a priority on getting our people as close as possible to their ideal work contents and contexts. Because whatever our career stage, we all do our best when we’re doing what we love in the right place. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0845Q9PJM&location=624))

- The best leaders understand and accept this and consistently resist the temptation to do anything other than lead by (1) recognizing the importance of their time and what they spend it on; (2) resisting the urge to do something because they can; and (3) developing trust in their subordinates by giving them the space to make mistakes—and ultimately, to figure things out.
