## Highlights
- I provided seven categories: planning (setting up meetings, arranging calls, etc.), informational (which I defined as not requiring a response), administrative, work discussion, client communication, personal, and miscellaneous. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=359))
- The average number of planning, administrative, work discussion, client communication, and miscellaneous emails received were all between eight and ten per day, with the average number of personal emails being slightly less. The only outlier was informational emails, which numbered eighteen per day on average. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=362))
- It’s no longer accurate to think of communication tools as occasionally interrupting work; the more realistic model is one in which knowledge workers essentially partition their attention into two parallel tracks: one executing work tasks and the other managing an always-present, ongoing, and overloaded electronic conversation about these tasks. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=365))
- The modern knowledge work organization truly does operate like a hive mind—a collective intelligence of many different brains tethered electronically into a dynamic ebb and flow of information and concurrent conversations. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=370))
- For example, one of Jersild’s experiments presented the subjects with a column of two-digit numbers. One task was to add 6 to each number and the other was to subtract 3. If you asked the subjects to perform just one task repetitively, like adding 6 to every number in the list, they finished much faster than if you asked them to alternate between adding and subtracting.15 When Jersild made the tasks more complex, by asking the subjects to now add seventeen and subtract thirteen, the difference in completion times got even larger, indicating that more involved tasks require more involved switching.

- “Every time you switch your attention from one task to another, you’re basically asking your brain to switch all of these cognitive resources,” ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=438))
- the current context in which knowledge workers operate as a state of “divided attention,” in which the mind rarely gets closure before switching tasks, creating a muddle of competing activations and inhibitions that all add up to reduce our performance. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=440))
- He saw himself like an orchestra conductor, keeping everyone’s actions coordinated—his presence in the middle of this frenetic scrum was where he believed he was most valuable. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=451))
- the ability to slow down, tackle things sequentially, and give each task uninterrupted attention is crucial, even if the role doesn’t regularly require hours of continuous deep thinking. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=465))
- the hyperactive hive mind workflow, which derails attempts at clear cognition, makes you less productive. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=466))
- “[The War Department] is filled with able men who analyze the problems well but feel compelled always to bring them to me for final solution. I must have assistants who will solve their own problems and tell me later what they have done.” ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=505))
- Knowledge work is better understood as the combination of two components: work execution and workflow. The first component, work execution, describes the act of actually executing the underlying value-producing activities of knowledge work—the programmer coding, the publicist writing the press release. It’s how you generate value from attention capital. The second component, workflow, is one we defined in the introduction of this book. It describes how these fundamental activities are identified, assigned, coordinated, and reviewed. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1709))
- Differentiating workflows and work execution is crucial if we’re going to continue to improve knowledge sector productivity. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1732))
- Minimize Context Switches and Overload ([Location 1736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1736))
- seek workflows that (1) minimize mid-task context switches and (2) minimize the sense of communication overload. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BKSJX1M&location=1747))
