# Plugins

- Gradianto Theme https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12334-gradianto

This theme is not as heavy or complete as the Material theme but it provides a set of nice themes to use

- Atom Material Icons https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10044-atom-material-icons

This icons just make the IDE look way better!

- Save Actions https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions

I use this to organize imports on save and can also be used to do more powerful things.
