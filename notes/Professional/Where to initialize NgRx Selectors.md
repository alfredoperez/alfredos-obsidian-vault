## TL;DR

When using the selector in the component, it is recommended not to initialize them in the declaration and instead initialize them in the constructor.

```ts
export class FindBookPageComponent {
  searchQuery$: Observable<string>;
  books$: Observable<Book[]>;
  loading$: Observable<boolean>;
  error$: Observable<string>;

  constructor(private store: Store<fromBooks.State>) {
    this.searchQuery$ = store.pipe(
      select(fromBooks.selectSearchQuery),
      take(1)
    );
    this.books$ = store.pipe(select(fromBooks.selectSearchResults));
    this.loading$ = store.pipe(select(fromBooks.selectSearchLoading));
    this.error$ = store.pipe(select(fromBooks.selectSearchError));
  }

  search(query: string) {
    this.store.dispatch(FindBookPageActions.searchBooks({ query }));
  }
}
```

## Angular Type Safety

Initializing in the constructor helps because when using the **strict mode in TypeScript**, the compiler will not be able to know that the selectors were initialized on `ngOnInit`

The strictPropertyInitialization was added by default in the `--strict` mode in Angular 9.


The following checks where also added:
```json
{
  "//": "tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```


>The strict-mode allows us to write much safe and robust application. Honestly, I think all Angular application should be written in strict-mode, but it is a little hard to understand every error messages caused by the compiler.
