There are different types of states and not all the state belongs into NgRx store. The following image shows some types of state

Global store better suited for managing global shared state, where [Component Store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store/comparison#benefits-and-trade-offs) shines managing more local, encapsulated state, as well as component UI state.

Always make sure that the state in the NgRx store really needs to be there!
