## Highlights
- The ProFAST diet is a six-week program to optimize blood sugar levels, reduce liver and visceral fat, and reverse type-2 or pre-diabetes using a therapeutic eating plan based on the protein-sparing modified fast. ([Location 1829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1829))
- one of the most significant drawbacks is a loss of lean body mass during extended fasts. While this effect is diminished in obese people, there is still a significant loss of lean body mass during prolonged fasts. ([Location 1835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1835))
- Significant weight loss in overweight individuals, leading to a reduction of central adiposity. Significant decreases in fasting blood glucose. Decreased use of diabetes medications and insulin. Significant reduction of HgA1c (up to 3 percent). Decreased fasting insulin and reduction of insulin resistance. Decreased triglycerides and increased HDL. Lower blood pressure and discontinuation of blood pressure medications. Improved kidney function and reduction of kidney markers.

- At the end of just eight weeks, the participants, on average, dropped their HbA1c from 7.4 percent to 6.0 percent, lost twenty-nine pounds, and reduced their fasting insulin levels by almost 60 percent.147 Furthermore, in the test group, liver fat was reduced by 70 percent and pancreatic fat by almost 25 percent. At the end of the study, patients’ levels of organ fat were similar to those of the non-diabetic control group.

- It involves an energy-restricted diet of around 600–800 calories per day, prioritizing protein from high-quality sources such as lean beef, chicken, turkey, fish, seafood, and eggs. In addition to the protein, you’ll be eating fibrous vegetables such as leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and salads with a minimal amount of fats and oils. What you won’t be eating is fruits, nuts, fatty cuts of meat, avocado, coconut, beans, grains, and sugars. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1898))

- “Am I willing to follow a restrictive, limited eating plan for six weeks so that I can thoroughly enjoy the rest of my life?” ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1906))

- During the first two weeks, we recommend that you follow a low-carbohydrate diet, focusing on eating less than 100 grams of carbohydrates per day. You can then start incorporating more protein into your diet, and there’s no need to restrict healthy fats. ([Location 1934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1934))
- “I commit to my health and myself by working on reducing body fat and blood sugar by getting regular physical activity, monitoring my food intake, and eating foods consistent with my long-term goals to reverse diabetes, while staying positive and enjoying this process of becoming a healthier version of myself.” ([Location 1947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094CLDQ2L&location=1947))

- During the ProFAST diet, you can eat two to three times per day within a restricted eating window. This time frame should be no more than twelve hours, and most people find that they do better with a six- to ten-hour eating window.
