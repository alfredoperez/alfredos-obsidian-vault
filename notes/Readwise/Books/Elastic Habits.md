## Highlights
- “Just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.” ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08188WBGC&location=153))
