## Highlights
- You need a good title, and a mission statement of what you are trying to achieve with the article
- I've found it easier to find multiple good titles than to find only one. By that I mean that coming up with a good title when I'm exhausted after finishing an article is hard. On the other hand, if my relaxed brain focus only of coming up with topics, titles and mission statements, my creativity kicks in.
- For this you need to set the Canonical URL to link to a copy hosted on your own blog. This will tell Google where the article originally comes from.
- If you have spent time and effort in your article, you don't want it to to look like a boring link when shared on Twitter/Slack/Whatever.
  Therefore you need a cover image of size 1000x420.
