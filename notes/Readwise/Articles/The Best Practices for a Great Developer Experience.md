## Highlights
- verbosity is always great in docs. You can never say too much. It’ll be one sentence or a few extra words that really helps a stuck developer. It’ll mean the difference between a developer who feels comfortable and supported versus an irate one calling your support line. Docs can sometimes feel like a last minute thing, but slowing down, investing in them, will pay dividends in the long run
- If you’re shipping anything that a developer will use, be sure to always test it as if you’re a new developer. Create a fresh project, integrate it and test it. Try to rule out any false positives from your dev environment and really just eat your own dog food. The more you do this, the more knowledgable you’ll be about the integration process, and that’ll lead to finding gaps in documentation
- Why does it matter? DX matters for the same reasons good UX matters. Users of your technology are happier, promote it more, and stay longer when the product has good DX. Happy developers are chatty developers, and when we talk to each other to recommend products, the ones with the best DX are at the top of the list. Follows is my list of best practices when it comes to DX. Do these, and you’re well on your way to success
- Developer Experience (DX) is the equivalent to User Experience (UX) when the user of the software or system is a developer. DX describes the experience developers have when they use your product, be it client libraries, SDKs, frameworks, open source code, tools, API, technology or service. DX shares some ideas and philosophies from UX design (or HCI), but builds on these with an eye towards modern technology and standards
