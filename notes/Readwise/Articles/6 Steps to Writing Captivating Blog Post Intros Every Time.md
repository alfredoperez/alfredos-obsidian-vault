## Highlights
- Use
- Finally, show your readers how you’ll fulfill your promise. This will lead them into your blog post’s body seamlessly to keep them reading. Typically, this will be something along the lines of, “Follow these tips…” or “Read on to learn how…” but you can certainly get creative.
- Step 3: Identify your readers’ problem
- Pose a question about what your readers might want. Tell a story about results successful people have seen in the past. Give a number to how much time or money they dream of saving.
- Use the word “you,” or directly ask your readers a question.
- Step 1: Address your readers from sentence one
- Instead of launching with your own story, pull the reader into it by addressing them right away
- This problem might be lack of knowledge, poor results, wasted time, wasted money, etc
- Step 5: Promise something the reader wants
- Step 6: Transition by hinting at how to solve their problem
- You’ve identified what your readers want, and it’s time to promise that they’ll get it. This is typically a short phrase, such as: It’s possible! I’ll show you how. It’s easier than you think.
- Every blog post you write should aim to solve a problem, such as by educating, informing, or entertaining someone. After all, who’s going to read your content if it’s not going to help them?
- Step 4: Play off their hopes and dreams
- Step 2: Launch by describing an emotion
