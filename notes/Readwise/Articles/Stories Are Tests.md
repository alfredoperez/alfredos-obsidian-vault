## Highlights
- You can use them with Testing Library to verify interactions and underlying logic. In Chromatic for visual regression testing. Or Axe to audit accessibility. Or Cypress to test user flows. All powered by the same set of stories!
- What about components that are more than a simple function? Complex components rely on context, data, application state and more. Once youâ€™ve configured that in Storybook, you can reuse the configuration in other testing tools.
